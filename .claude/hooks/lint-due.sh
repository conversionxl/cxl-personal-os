# /lint is the vault's health check, but nothing schedules it, so it only runs
# when you happen to remember. A check that depends on being remembered is not
# a check. This closes the loop the cheap way: no model call, no cron, no cloud
# agent. It just reads the newest daily-logs/<date>-lint.md and, if it is older
# than the lint cadence, prints one line into session context.
#
# Deliberately quiet when the lint is current. A nudge that fires every session
# is noise, and noise gets muted.

# The headless daily-log worker sets this. It must not receive the nudge.
