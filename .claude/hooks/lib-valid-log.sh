# Shared validity predicate for generated daily logs.
#
# The headless worker that writes daily logs can fail in ways that still produce
# output: an API error string, a truncated response, a refusal. A plain
# non-empty check accepts all of those, and once a bad file lands the catch-up
# hook treats the day as handled and never revisits it. So the day is lost.
# Both log hooks route their output through is_valid_log before it reaches disk.
#
# Source this file, then call: is_valid_log <file>

# A log is valid only if it has the section heading the generator prompt
# mandates and enough body to be worth keeping.
LOG_MIN_LINES=10

# Max characters kept per string when a transcript is fed to the generator.
# Both log hooks truncate to this. A heavy day (large file reads, big tool
# results) can otherwise overflow the model's context, and the failed run leaves
# no log, which is indistinguishable on disk from a day with no work in it.

# Does a transcript slice contain any turn the user actually typed?
#
# The SessionEnd hook only ever sees its own transcript. A session that opened
# and closed without a prompt (an editor window reopened, a connector check, a
# crashed session relaunched) therefore generated a log saying no work was
# captured, and that log is well formed, so is_valid_log accepts it and catch-up
# treats the day as handled and never revisits it. If the sessions that did the
# work were killed rather than closed, a whole day reads as "nothing happened".
#
# So: a session with no user turns must not write the day's log. Leaving the day
# blank is recoverable, because catch-up merges every transcript for a date.
#
# Hook-injected and tool-result messages carry .type == "user" too, so counting
# user messages alone would accept exactly the empty sessions this rejects. Only
# plain text content authored in the prompt counts. Without jq, return true: the
# old behavior is wrong but it is not this function's job to suppress logs on a
# machine where the question cannot be asked.

# is_valid_log asks whether the generator produced well-formed output, and is
# correct for that job. But hand-authored logs are also written to these files:
# a note you typed into today's log by hand, or an interrupted /shutdown,
# leaves content without that heading. Those legitimately have no
# "## Session Summary" heading, so is_valid_log rejects them, and both log
# hooks then treated "not a well-formed generated log" as "safe to destroy".
# Nothing errors when that happens, so the loss goes unnoticed.
#
# Callers that are about to overwrite or quarantine an EXISTING file must use
# this predicate. Only the generator's own fresh output should be judged by
